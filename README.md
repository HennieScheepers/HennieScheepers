### Hi there 👋 My name is Hennie Scheepers. I am currently working on a quotes calculator for The Feisty Feline to help determine the amount charged for their rugs. This is a pro bono project and helps me fulfil my passion for helping individuals solve their problems with tech 👨🏻‍💻 I am currently learning software development at CodeSpace Academy. It focuses heavily on the front-end. My tech stack thus far consist of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. My end goal with this course is to enter the tech field by landing a junior software development role and providing my value to help solve people's problems 😄 You can find me on LinkedIn(https://www.linkedin.com/in/hennie-scheepers-8369b1246/) and also here, on GitHub.
