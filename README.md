### Hi there 👋 My name is Hennie Scheepers. 

I am currently working on a quotes calculator for The Feisty Feline to help determine the amount charged for their rugs. This is a pro bono project and helps me fulfil my passion for helping individuals solve their problems with tech 👨🏻‍💻 

I am currently learning software development at CodeSpace Academy. It focuses heavily on the front-end. My tech stack thus far consist of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. My end goal with this course is to leave the hospitality sector and break out into tech by landing a junior software development role and providing my value to help solve people's problems 😄

I have a passion for learning new technologies as they help built the tools I have at my disposal to come up with creative solutions to the problems we face in the world today 📚
